# QmlConventionChecker

Run program with QML source file(s) or path(s) as argument(s).

Program will report violations of http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-codingconventions.html to stderr.

This relies on the Qt 5.6 internal parser.

On a Debian based distribution you can get its headers by installing qtdeclarative5-private-dev.
